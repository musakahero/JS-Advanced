Problems for exercises and homework for the ["JavaScript Advanced" course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3588/js-advanced-january-2022). Submit your solutions in the SoftUni judge system at <https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/2759/Objects-and-Composition-Exercise>.
1. ## **Calorie Object**
Write a function that composes an object by given properties. The input comes as an **array of strings**. Every **even index** of the array represents the **name of the food**. Every **odd index** is a **number** that is equal to the **calories in 100 grams of the given product**. Assign each value to its corresponding property, and finally print the object.

The **input** comes as an **array of string** **elements**.

The **output** should be printed on the console.
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|**['Yoghurt', '48', 'Rise', '138', 'Apple', '52']**|**{ Yoghurt: 48, Rise: 138, Apple: 52 }**|
|**['Potato', '93', 'Skyr', '63', 'Cucumber', '18', 'Milk', '42']**|**{ Potato: 93, Skyr: 63, Cucumber: 18, Milk: 42 }**|
1. ## **Construction Crew**
Write a program that receives a **worker** object as a parameter and modifies its properties. Workers have the following structure:

**{**

`  `**weight: Number,**

`  `**experience: Number,**

`  `**levelOfHydrated: Number,**

`  `**dizziness: Boolean** 

**}**

**Weight** is expressed in **kilograms**, **experience** in **years** and **levelOfHydrated** is in **milliliters**. If you receive a worker whose **dizziness** property is set to **true** it means he needs to intake some **water** to be able to work correctly. The required amount is 0.1ml per **kilogram** per year of **experience**. The required amount must be **added** to the **existing amount (to the levelOfHydrated)**. Once the water is administered, change the **dizziness** property to **false**.

Workers who **do not have dizziness** should **not** be modified in any way. Return them as they were.
### **Input**
Your function will receive a valid **object** as a **parameter**.
### **Output**
Return the **same object** that was passed in, **modified** as necessary.

### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**{ weight: 80,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 1,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 0,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: true }**</p>|<p>**{ weight: 80,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 1,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 8,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: false }**</p>|
|<p>**{ weight: 120,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 20,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 200,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: true }**</p>|<p>**{ weight: 120,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 20,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 440,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: false }**</p>|
|<p>**{ weight: 95,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 3,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 0,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: false }**</p>|<p>**{ weight: 95,**</p><p>`  `**experience: 3,**</p><p>`  `**levelOfHydrated: 0,**</p><p>`  `**dizziness: false }**</p>|
1. ## **Car Factory**
Write a program that assembles a car by **giving requirements** out of **existing** **components**. The client will place an order in the form of an **object describing** the car. You need to **determine** which parts to use to fulfill the client’s order. You have the following parts in storage:

An **engine** has **power** (given in horsepower) and **volume** (given in cubic centimeters). Both of these values are **numbers**. When selecting an engine, pick the **smallest possible** that still meets the requirements.

**Small engine: { power: 90, volume: 1800 }**

**Normal engine: { power: 120, volume: 2400 }**

**Monster engine: { power: 200, volume: 3500 }**

A **carriage** has a **type** and **color**. Both of these values are **strings**. You have two types of carriages in storage and can paint them **any color**.

**Hatchback: { type: 'hatchback', color: <as required> }**

**Coupe: { type: 'coupe', color: <as required> }**

The **wheels** will be represented by an **array** of 4 **numbers**, each number represents the **diameter** of the wheel in inches. The size can only be an **odd number**. Round **down** any requirements you receive to the nearest odd number. 
### **Input**
You will receive an **object** as an **argument** to your function. The format will be as follows:

**{ model: <model name>,**

`  `**power: <minimum power>,**

`  `**color: <color>,**

`  `**carriage: <carriage type>,**

`  `**wheelsize: <size> }**
### **Output**
**Return** the resulting car **object** as a result of your function. See the examples for details.
### **Examples**

|**Sample input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**{ model: 'VW Golf II',**</p><p>`  `**power: 90,**</p><p>`  `**color: 'blue',**</p><p>`  `**carriage: 'hatchback',**</p><p>`  `**wheelsize: 14 }**</p>|<p>**{ model: 'VW Golf II',**</p><p>`  `**engine: { power: 90,**</p><p>`            `**volume: 1800 },**</p><p>`  `**carriage: { type: 'hatchback',**</p><p>`              `**color: 'blue' },**</p><p>`  `**wheels: [13, 13, 13, 13] }**</p>|
|<p>**{ model: 'Opel Vectra',**</p><p>`  `**power: 110,**</p><p>`  `**color: 'grey',**</p><p>`  `**carriage: 'coupe',**</p><p>`  `**wheelsize: 17 }**</p>|<p>**{ model: 'Opel Vectra',**</p><p>`  `**engine: { power: 120,**</p><p>`            `**volume: 2400 },**</p><p>`  `**carriage: { type: 'coupe',**</p><p>`              `**color: 'grey' },**</p><p>`  `**wheels: [17, 17, 17, 17] }**</p>|
1. ## **Heroic Inventory**
In the era of heroes, every hero has his items that make him unique. Create a function that creates a **register for the heroes**, with their **names**, **level**, and **items**, if they have such. The register should accept data in a specified format, and return it presented in a specified format. 
### **Input**
The **input** comes as an array of strings. Each element holds data for a hero, in the following format:

"**{heroName} / {heroLevel} / {item1}, {item2}, {item3}...**"

You must store the data about every hero. The **name** is a **string**, a **level** is a **number** and the items are all **strings.**
### **Output**
The **output** is a **JSON representation** of the data for all the heroes you’ve stored. The data must be an **array of all the heroes**. Check the examples for more info.
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**['Isacc / 25 / Apple, GravityGun',**</p><p>**'Derek / 12 / BarrelVest, DestructionSword',**</p><p>**'Hes / 1 / Desolator, Sentinel, Antara']**</p>|[{"name":"Isacc","level":25,"items":["Apple","GravityGun"]},{"name":"Derek","level":12,"items":["BarrelVest","DestructionSword"]},{"name":"Hes","level":1,"items":["Desolator","Sentinel","Antara"]}]|
|**['Jake / 1000 / Gauss, HolidayGrenade']**|[{"name":"Jake","level":1000,"items":["Gauss","HolidayGrenade"]}]|
### **Hints**
- We need an array that will hold our hero data. That is the first thing we create.

![](Aspose.Words.c2ceef7f-902e-4288-ace5-c2c019e1285d.001.png)

- Next, we need to loop over the whole input and process it. Let’s do that with a simple **for** loop.

![](Aspose.Words.c2ceef7f-902e-4288-ace5-c2c019e1285d.002.png)

- Every element from the input holds data about a hero, however, the **elements from the data** we need are **separated by some delimiter**, so we just split each string with that **delimiter**.
- Next, we need to take the elements from the **string array**, which is a result of the **string split**, and by destructuring assignment syntax, we assign the array properties. Don’t forget to parse the number.

- However, here we remember there is something special about the items, so read the problem definition again, you will notice that there might be a **case** where the hero **has** **no items**; in that case, using **destructuring** is ok and when there are no items, our property items will be undefined and trying to spit it will throw an error.  That is why we need to perform a simple check using the [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

![](Aspose.Words.c2ceef7f-902e-4288-ace5-c2c019e1285d.003.png)

- If **there are any items** in the **input**, the **variable** will be set to the **split version of them**. If not, it will just be set to an **empty array**.
- We have now extracted the needed data – we have stored the **input name** in a **variable**, we have parsed the **given level** to a **number**, and we have also **split** the **items** that the **hero holds** by their **delimiter**, which would result in a **string array** of elements. By definition, the **items** are **strings**, so we don’t need to process the array we’ve made anymore. 
- Now what is left is to add that data into **an object** and **add** that object to the **array**.  

![](Aspose.Words.c2ceef7f-902e-4288-ace5-c2c019e1285d.004.png)

- Lastly, we need to turn the array of objects we have made, into a JSON string, which is done by the **JSON.stringify()** function

1. ## **Lowest Prices in Cities**
You will be given several towns, with products and their price. You need to find **the lowest price** for **every product** and **the town it is sold at** for that price.
### **Input**
The **input** comes as an array of strings. Each element will hold data about a **town**, **product**, and **its price** at that town. The **town** and **product** will be **strings**, the **price** will be a **number**. The input will come in the following format:

**{townName} | {productName} | {productPrice}**
### **Output**
As **output**, you must print **each** **product** with its **lowest price** and **the town** at which the product is **sold at that** **price**. If **two towns share** the **same lowest price**, print the one that was **entered first**. 
The output, for every product, should be in the following format:

**{productName} -> {productLowestPrice} ({townName})**

The **order of output** in - **order of entrance**. See the examples for more info.
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |

1. ## **Store Catalogue**
You have to create a sorted catalog of store products. You will be given the products’ names and prices. You need to order them in **alphabetical order**. 
### **Input**
The **input** comes as an array of strings. Each element holds info about a product in the following format:

"**{productName} : {productPrice}**"

The **product’s name** will be a **string**, which will **always** **start with a capital letter**, and the **price** will be **a number**. There will be **NO duplicate product input**. The comparison for alphabetical order is **case-insensitive**.
### **Output**
As **output**, you must print all the products in a specified format. They must be ordered **exactly as specified above**. The products must be **divided into groups**, by the **initial of their name**. The **group's initial should be printed**, and after that, the products should be printed with **2 spaces before their names**. For more info check the examples.

1. ## **Towns to JSON**
You're tasked to create and print a JSON from a text table. You will receive input as an array of strings, where each string represents a row of a table, with values on the row encompassed by pipes **"|"** and optionally spaces. The table will consist of exactly 3 columns **"Town"**, **"Latitude"** and **"Longitude"**. The **Latitude** and **Longitude** columns will always contain **valid numbers**. Check the examples to get a better understanding of your task.
### **Input**
The **input** comes as an array of strings – the first string contains the table’s headings, each next string is a row from the table.
### **Output**
- The **output** should be an array of objects wrapped in **JSON.stringify()**. 
- **Latitude** and **Longitude** must be parsed to **numbers,** and represented till the **second digit after the decimal point**!
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**['| Town | Latitude | Longitude |',**</p><p>**'| Sofia | 42.696552 | 23.32601 |',**</p><p>**'| Beijing | 39.913818 | 116.363625 |']**</p>|<p>**[{"Town":"Sofia",**</p><p>`  `**"Latitude":42.7,**</p><p>`  `**"Longitude":23.32**</p><p>**},<br>{"Town":"Beijing",** </p><p>` `**"Latitude":39.91,** </p><p>` `**"Longitude":116.36**</p><p>**}]**</p>|
|<p>**['| Town | Latitude | Longitude |',**</p><p>**'| Veliko Turnovo | 43.0757 | 25.6172 |',**</p><p>**'| Monatevideo | 34.50 | 56.11 |']**</p>|<p>**[{"Town":"Veliko Turnovo",**</p><p>`  `**"Latitude":43.08,**</p><p>`  `**"Longitude":25.62**</p><p>**},<br>{"Town":"Monatevideo",**</p><p>` `**"Latitude":34.5,**</p><p>` `**"Longitude":56.11**</p><p>**}]**</p>|
1. ## **Rectangle**
Write a **function** that creates and returns a rectangle object. The rectangle needs to have a **width** (Number), **height** (Number), and **color** (String) properties, which are set via arguments during creation, and a **calcArea()** method, that calculates and **returns** the rectangle’s area.
### **Input**
The function will receive three valid parameters – **width** (Number), **height** (Number), and **color** (String).
### **Output**
Your function must return an object with all properties and methods as described. The **calcArea()** method of the object should **return** a number. The first letter in the color must be **upperCase().**
### **Examples**

|**Sample Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**let rect = rectangle(4, 5, 'red');**</p><p>**console.log(rect.width);**</p><p>**console.log(rect.height);**</p><p>**console.log(rect.color);**</p><p>**console.log(rect.calcArea());**</p>|<p>**4**</p><p>**5**</p><p>**Red**</p><p>**20**</p>|
1. ## **Sorted List\***
Create a function that returns a special **object**, which **keeps** a list of numbers, sorted in **ascending order**. It must support the following functionality:

- **add(element)** - adds a new element to the collection
- **remove(index)** - removes the element at position **index**
- **get(index)** - returns the value of the element at position **index**
- **size** - number of elements stored in the collection

The **correct order** of the elements must be kept **at all times**, regardless of which operation is called. **Removing** and **retrieving** elements **shouldn’t** **work** if the provided index points **outside the length** of the collection (either throw an error or do nothing). Note the **size** of the collection is **not** a function.
### **Input / Output**
The initial function takes no arguments and must **return** an **object**.

All methods on the object that expect **input** will receive data as **parameters**. Methods that have **validation** will be tested with both **valid and invalid** data. Any result expected from a method should be **returned** as its result.
### **Examples**

|**Sample Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>**let list = createSortedList();**</p><p>**list.add(5);**</p><p>**list.add(6);**</p><p>**list.add(7);**</p><p>**console.log(list.get(1));** </p><p>**list.remove(1);**</p><p>**console.log(list.get(1));**</p>|<p>**6**</p><p>**7**</p>|
1. ## **Heroes**
Create a function that **returns** an **object** with 2 methods (**mage** and **fighter**). This object should be able to **create** heroes (fighters and mages). Every hero has a **state**.

- Fighters have a **name**, **health = 100,** and **stamina = 100** and every fighter can fight.  When he **fights** his **stamina** **decreases** by **1** and the following message is **printed** on the console:

**`${fighter's name} slashes at the foe!`**

- Mages also have state (**name**, **health = 100** and **mana = 100**). Every mage can **cast** **spells**. When a spell is cast the mage's **mana** **decreases** by **1** and the following message is **printed** on the console:

**`${mage's name} cast ${spell}`**

### **Note:** 
For more information check the examples below.

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :-: | :-: |
|<p>let create = solve();</p><p>const scorcher = create.mage("Scorcher");</p><p>scorcher.cast("fireball")</p><p>scorcher.cast("thunder")</p><p>scorcher.cast("light")</p><p></p><p>const scorcher2 = create.fighter("Scorcher 2");</p><p>scorcher2.fight()</p><p></p><p>console.log(scorcher2.stamina);</p><p>console.log(scorcher.mana);</p><p></p>|<p>**Scorcher cast fireball**</p><p>**Scorcher cast thunder**</p><p>**Scorcher cast light**</p><p>**Scorcher 2 slashes at the foe!**</p><p>**99**</p><p>**97**</p><p></p>|

1. ## **Jan's Notation \***
Write a program that parses a series of instructions written in **postfix notation** and executes them (postfix means the operator is written **after** the operands). You will receive a **series of instructions** – if the instruction is a **number**, **save it**; otherwise, the instruction is an **arithmetic operator**(**+-\*/**) and you must apply it to the most two **most recently saved** numbers. **Discard** these two numbers and in their place, **save the result** of the operation – this number is now eligible to be an **operand** in a subsequent operation. Keep going until all input instructions have been exhausted, or you encounter an **error**.

In the end, if you’re left with a **single saved number**, this is the **result** of the calculation and you must **print** it. If there are more numbers saved, then the user-supplied **too many instructions** and you must print "**Error: too many operands!**". If at any point during the calculation you **don’t have** two numbers saved, the user-supplied **too few instructions** and you must print "**Error: not enough operands!**".  *See the examples for more details.*
### **Input**
You will receive an array with numbers **and** strings – the numbers will be **operands** and must be saved; the strings will be **arithmetic operators** that must be applied to the operands.
### **Output**
Print on the **console** on a single line the **final result** of the calculation or an **error message**, as instructed above.
### **Constraints**
- The **numbers** (operands) will be integers
- The **strings** (operators) will always be one of **+-\*/**
- The result of each operation will be in the range [-253…253-1] (**MAX\_SAFE\_INTEGER** will **never** be exceeded)
### **Examples**

|**Input**|**Output**|**Explanation**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|<p>**[3,**</p><p>` `**4,**</p><p>` `**'+']**</p>|**7**|<p>The first instruction is a **number**, therefore we **save** it. The next one is also a **number**, we **save** it too.</p><p>The third instruction is a **string**, so it must be an **operator** – we **remove the last two** numbers we saved, and operate: **3+4=7**. The result of this operation is then **saved** where the two operands **used to be**.</p><p>We’ve run out of instructions, so we check the saved values – we only have **one**, so this must be the **final result**. We **print** it on the console.</p>|
|<p>**[5,**</p><p>` `**3,**</p><p>` `**4,**</p><p>` `**'\*',**</p><p>` `**'-']**</p>|**-7**|<p>We save in order **5**, **3,** and **4**. The result of operation **3\*4** is **12**, which we **save in place** of **3** and **4**.</p><p>Currently, we have **5** and **12** saved. The result of the operation **5-12** is **-7**, which we **save in place** of **5** and **12**.</p><p>We have no more instructions and **only one** value saved, which we **print**.</p>|






|**Input**|**Output**||**Input**|**Output**|
